# kelt_vnc_server
Shared scripts to start/stop user-specific VNC sessions at ACCRE for KELT data reduction.

Installation
============

Start by creating a location in your home directory where git projects can
be checked out (I use "~/repo" but you can do whatever you want). Check out
the project into that folder as follows:
```
$ mkdir -p ~/repo    # in case it does not exist yet
$ cd ~/repo
$ git clone https://github.com/rsiverd/kelt_vnc_server.git
```
That should be everything.
